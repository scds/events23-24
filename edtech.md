# EdTech Inc., Revisited

Join Dr. Tanner Mirrlees for a talk on the rise of the EdTech industry. Using a political economy of communication framework, Mirrlees presents an overview of the EdTech industry and probes the forces and relations underpinning the digitization, commercialization, platformization, automation, and globalization of higher education. Offering a counterpoint to techno-deterministic and techno-optimistic narratives about EdTech, Mirrlees considers the ethical and social dimensions of the EdTech industryâ€™s impact on teacher labor, student learning, and the public education sector as a whole. 

Sponsored by the Sherman Centre, the Communications Governance Observatory, the Canada Research Chairs program, the Faculty of Humanities, and the Department of Communication Studies and Media Arts.
